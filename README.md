## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/xuewyang/xuewyang.github.io-blog/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/xuewyang/xuewyang.github.io-blog/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### A basic template to get started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project is a fork of the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com).  
It has been simplified for those starting out with web development and programming.

An [**example site**](http://pfnp.adrianbautista.com) built with this template.

## Quick start

### How to download this template:

1. **Easy Way** - Download the `.zip` file
* You can use the "Download ZIP" button in the right sidebar or click [this link](https://github.com/adrianbautista/html-css-template/archive/pfnp.zip).
* Unzip the template by double clicking on the downloaded `html-css-template-pfnp.zip` file.
2. **Programmer Way** - Clone the Git Repo
* If you have git on your computer and a github account, you can clone this project from the command line
```
git clone https://github.com/adrianbautista/html-css-template.git
```

### How to use this template:

1. Opening the template
* If you downloaded the zip file, open the unzipped **folder** `html-css-template-pfnp` in a text editor  
(e.g. [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)).
* If you cloned the project using git, open the **folder** `html-css-template` in a text editor  
(e.g. [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)).

2. Using the template  

#### HTML
* Start with `index.html`, this will be your root page (the main page)  
Questions about its content? Refer to `template.html`  
* To make new HTML pages, duplicate `template.html` inside the folder and rename it to the URL path you want.  
```
about.html => my_website.com/about
```  
*It's recommended that you delete the explanation comments in any new HTML pages*

#### CSS
* Start with `main.css` inside the `css` folder
* What are `normalize.css` and `html5-boilerplate.css` for?  
They make basic styles consistent across all kinds of web browsers

#### JavaScript
* Start with `main.js` inside the `js` folder
* What's jQuery? It's a JavaScript library that allows you to manipulate your website much more easily with JavaScript
* If you download any jQuery plugins, paste a minified version of them into `plugins.js`

#### Images
* If you want to host your own images, put the image file (.jpg, .png, .gif) inside the images directory.  
Then the source on an **img tag** will be  
```
<img src="/images/your_picture.jpg">
```
